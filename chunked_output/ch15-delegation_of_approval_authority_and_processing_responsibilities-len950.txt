university of richmond | 4
delegation of transactions that do not involve approval
responsibilities for transactions that do not involve approvals should also be delegated if the employee has
plans to be away from the university for five or more days to ensure that university business transactions are
not delayed as a result of an absence. delegation of responsibilities for transactions that do not include approvals may only be made to someone
who has knowledge of the transactions and all relevant policies, regulations, and restrictions associated with
the transactions. typically, delegation will be made to someone who has those same responsibilities for
another area:
• employees with responsibility for completing and submitting specialized hr transactions may
delegate those responsibilities to an individual who has those same responsibilities for another area.
