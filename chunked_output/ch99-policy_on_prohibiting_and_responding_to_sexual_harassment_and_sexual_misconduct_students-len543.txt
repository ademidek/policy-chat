non-emergency medical procedures
even if someone chooses not to have a hospital exam, it is still important to get medical
attention. an exam, in these instances, will include treatment of any physical problems and lab
tests for sexually transmitted diseases and/or pregnancy. any non-emergency treatment can be
arranged on campus by calling the student health center
at (804) 289-8064 and making an
appointment.

students and employees may seek medical services after hours and on weekends at
st. mary's hospital and other local hospitals. 3.
