objects will be returned only to the lender of record unless otherwise directed by
the lender in writing not to do so. in the case of uncertainty, the museums reserve the right to require the
lender/claimant to establish title by proof satisfactory to the museums. these guidelines are conveyed to lenders via the museums' loan agreement form, issued upon agreement
between the museums and the lender, preferably prior to the museums' possession of the borrowed objects.
