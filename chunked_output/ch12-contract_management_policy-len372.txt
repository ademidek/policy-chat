fin-4408.3 – contracts
not all university purchases require a written contract. however, when a written contract is required by
either party, the contract must be reviewed and approved in compliance with this policy and the funding
source must be clearly identified prior to contracting. an exchange of correspondence, including emails, can
also create a binding contract.
