process for addressing and managing actual, apparent or potential conflicts of interest
if it is determined that an actual, apparent or potential conflict exists, the secretary to the board of trustees
and/or the general counsel shall consult with the rector and the chair of the audit and compliance
committee, in the case of a member of the board of trustees (other than the rector or chair of the audit
and compliance committee) or a board committee, or with the president, in the case of other covered
persons, and, collectively, they shall take such action as may be reasonably necessary to eliminate such
conflict. the university of richmond recognizes that a blanket prohibition against transactions with a covered
person or employee is not in the university's best interest. such a prohibition could well result in the
imposition of higher prices, additional costs or other disadvantages to the university.
