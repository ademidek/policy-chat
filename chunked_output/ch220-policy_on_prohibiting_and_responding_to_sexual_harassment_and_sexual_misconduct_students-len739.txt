virginia law requires that a prominent notation be added to the academic transcript
of any student who is suspended for, permanently separated for, or withdraws from the university while
under investigation for an offense involving sexual violence. this transcript notation will be removed if
a student is subsequently found not to have committed an offense involving sexual violence or if the
student completes their term of suspension and is determined to be in good standing according to
applicable university policy. consistent with state law and federal regulations, the notation will be
removed from a transcript after three years for a student who withdraws while under investigation or is
permanently separated from the university.
