• faculty and staff organizers of student travel must complete the
online proposal for taking students
outside of the us and, if traveling to a location bearing a level 3 or 4 dos travel advisory, submit a
petition ideally 2-3 months prior to scheduled travel. student petitions will be reviewed by the travel risk and safety committee comprised of the dean of
international education; director of risk management and insurance; the provost; and university general
counsel. the committee normally reaches a decision within two weeks after submission of a complete
petition.
