the executive director has the sole authority to approve loans. the museums
reserve the right to determine when, if, and, for how long objects borrowed will be exhibited. loan periods are typically restricted to a maximum two-year duration, possibly longer if extended to the
needed length of time for traveling exhibition tours organized by the museums.
