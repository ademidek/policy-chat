trade secrets may be used to
protect forms of intellectual property which do not readily fall under the scope of trademark,
copyright or patent law protections. trade secrets may be protected as long as the owner
successfully prevents them from becoming widely known. if information becomes common
knowledge, it ceases to be a trade secret.
