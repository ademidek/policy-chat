employees are subject to the laws of the state in which they reside, and these taxes, labor and employment
laws, and workers compensation provisions vary from state to state. university employees who reside outside
virginia may also trigger additional legal, regulatory and compliance obligations beyond those relating to
employment. therefore, the hiring or reassignment of employees who reside outside of virginia must serve
an important university business purpose and not be merely an accommodation to the employee.
