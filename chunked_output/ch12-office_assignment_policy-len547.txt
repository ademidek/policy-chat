when
a new or replacement position is approved without a permanent office having been identified, facilities must
confirm a temporary office before a search can begin. in such instances, staff members may be assigned a
shared office space while the necessary project is planned and executed to make space available. it is the responsibility of the hiring vice president or dean to submit a project request to university facilities
by the annual deadline for any office upgrade or specialty research space needs that will be associated with a
hire.
