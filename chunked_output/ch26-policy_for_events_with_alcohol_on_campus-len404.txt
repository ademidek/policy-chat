wristbands may be
required for some events, but would not be required for private events such as weddings. at student centered events, it is the responsibility of the abc license holder to check for a valid personal
identification that verifies the age of the individuals entering an event. if the abc license holder is unable to
check ids, a third-party vendor must be hired to provide age verification.
