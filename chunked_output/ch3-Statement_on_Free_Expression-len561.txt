the university recognizes that on occasion some
members of the community may strongly disagree with the speech of others, or may view the
expression of certain ideas as harmful. on these occasions, it is for the members of the university
community to respond by openly and vigorously contesting the ideas that they oppose, not by
seeking to suppress speech. t he broad protection of freedom of expression is particularly
necessary for speakers and messages that challenge authority or the status quo, which frequently
have been the target of censorship efforts.
