as part of the request for a position, the vp or dean will
identify a proposed office assignment for the position – or indicate that no known office is available. the
university space manager will confirm the availability of the proposed office space or begin the process of
identifying available space. when a vp or dean makes a request to fill a vacant position, the vp or dean must propose the office into
which the replacement hire will move (typically the office being vacated).
