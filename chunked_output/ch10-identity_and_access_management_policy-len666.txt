least privilege: the principle of least privilege dictates that users should be granted the minimum necessary
access rights to perform their tasks and nothing more. this security concept aims to minimize potential
damage from compromised accounts, accidental errors, or malicious attacks by limiting the scope of
permissions. multi-factor authentication (mfa): multi-factor authentication (mfa) is a security measure that requires
users to provide more than one form of identification to access an account or system.

mfa is a layered
approach to security that makes it harder for unauthorized users to gain access to a system, even if one
credential is compromised.
