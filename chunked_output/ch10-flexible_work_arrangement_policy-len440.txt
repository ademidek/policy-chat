space allocation will be aligned with
flexible work arrangements; office-sharing and other kinds of arrangements will be implemented to
maximize the use of space among staff who are working remotely. flexible work arrangements are not part of the university employee benefits package. new funds will not
be added to accommodate a flexible work option, whether through additional hours or through the purchase
of equipment by the university.
