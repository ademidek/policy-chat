any employee receiving an allowance must provide their department with the device phone number and
maintain active cell phone service in order to continue receiving payment. employees are not required to
itemize their professional versus personal use of the phone or turn in monthly documentation, but they should
retain proof of purchase and monthly service plan records to document eligibility for participation in the
program. the purpose of this allowance is to help defray the business cost associated with owning and maintaining a
device and plan for employees whose primary job responsibilities require extensive travel on behalf of the
university.
