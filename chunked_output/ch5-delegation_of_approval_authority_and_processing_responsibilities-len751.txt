approval responsibilities
the approval process plays a critical role in ensuring that the activities undertaken by the university are in
alignment with the university's mission of teaching, research, scholarship and service; represent an
appropriate use of the university's charitable resources; and conform with institutional policies and
procedures. only authorized university employees (i.e., "approvers") have the authority to obligate the
university to receive or spend funds, provide or receive services, or otherwise commit institutional resources.
