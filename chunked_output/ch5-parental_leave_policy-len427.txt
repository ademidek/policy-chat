short term disability and family medical leave (fmla) will run concurrently. parental leave will normally
begin immediately following any short-term disability due to birth (std typically 6-8 weeks) unless the
employee is not eligible for parental leave at the time of birth. in such case the employee would take
parental leave once eligible, but within twelve (12) months of the birth, adoption, or state placement of a
child.
