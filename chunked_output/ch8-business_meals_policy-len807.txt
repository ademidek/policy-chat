community have a responsibility to exercise good judgment and prudence when incurring meal and
entertainment expenses on the university's behalf. the university will pay for reasonable, appropriately documented, and properly authorized meal and
entertainment expenses that are necessary to achieve a legitimate business purpose so long as those expenses
adhere to the guidelines outlined in this policy.
