when evaluating a potential delegate for financial transactions, it is important for the
approver to understand the delegate's responsibilities in their typical role so that the duties they will
temporarily assume on the approver's behalf will not conflict with the permissions/authorizations in their
usual position. to the extent that complete segregation of duties is not realistic due to the size of or expertise within a
department or unit, best efforts should be made to develop and maintain other preventative or detective
controls. units should consult with the office of internal audit or the controller's office to discuss any
unusual circumstances.
