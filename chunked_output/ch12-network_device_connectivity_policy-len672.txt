restricted network
the following categories of workstations and servers must use the restricted network:
• systems with obsolete operating systems or hardware for which patches for security vulnerabilities
are no longer available from the manufacturer or vendor
• systems that are not actively managed to install manufacturer-provided security patches in a timely
manner
• systems attached to obsolete equipment that preclude the patching of the system. users recognize that the devices on the restricted network are there because the devices represent a risk
to the campus network. note that these devices also represent a risk to other devices in the restricted
network.
