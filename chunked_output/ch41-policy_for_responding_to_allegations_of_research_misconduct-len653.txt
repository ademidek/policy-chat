upon receiving an allegation of research misconduct, the rio will immediately assess the allegation to
determine whether it is sufficiently credible and specific so that potential evidence of research misconduct may
be identified, whether it is within the jurisdictional criteria of 42 cfr § 93.i02(b), and whether the allegation
falls within the definition of research misconduct in 42 cfr § 93.103. 14 an inquiry must be conducted if these
criteria are met. if these criteria are not met, the rio can determine that there has been no research misconduct.
