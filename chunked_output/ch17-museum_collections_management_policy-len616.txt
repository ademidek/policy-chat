works from the permanent collection may be exhibited outside of the museums only if the area meets the
security and environmental standards of the museums. the executive director has the authority to approve
such placement and display, and museum staff will ensure that the area continues to meet these standards. since care of all objects on campus is of primary importance, the museums retain the right to determine
proper placement of any object to ensure that it is free of hazards.

it is the responsibility of the curator of
museum collections to monitor the condition of all campus objects on a regular basis.
