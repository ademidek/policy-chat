coercion is unreasonable, inappropriate pressure to engage in sexual activity. coercive
behavior is different than romantic or seductive behavior because coercive behavior involves
inappropriate or unreasonable pressure to obtain consent from another person for sexual activity. continued pressure to engage in sexual activity after the other person makes it clear that they do not want
to engage in, want to stop, or do not want to go further with sexual activity can be coercion.
