the alternative resolution process is designed to eliminate the
reoccurrence of the prohibited conduct and provide a remedy that meets the needs of both the
complainant and respondent while maintaining the safety of the campus community. alternative
resolution provides an opportunity for the complainant and respondent to discuss the complaint and the
alleged conduct and to communicate their feelings and perceptions regarding the conduct, the impact of
the conduct, and their wishes and expectations regarding their conduct in the future. if a mutually agreeable resolution is reached through the alternative resolution process, the matter will be
closed and there will be no formal sanction imposed under the standards of student conduct, unless the
respondent voluntarily agrees to accept a sanction.
