approved by the museums collections committee and then be presented to the university's gift acceptance
committee for final approval. when a gift is approved by the gift acceptance committee, the museums will
produce a written deed of gift that is binding when signed by the donor(s) and the museums executive
director. all acquisitions will be considered after careful evaluation based on, but not limited to, the following criteria:
• ability to physically and financially care for the objects;
• relevance to the museums' mission statement and collecting goals;
• aesthetic quality;
• evidence of authenticity;
• satisfactory provenance;
• pedagogical value;
• historical significance of the object, in terms of an artist's career, a historical movement, or relationship to
the university of richmond, the city of richmond, or the commonwealth of virginia;
• relationship to the collection's existing strengths and weaknesses;
