where a statement is required by the irs to confirm a donor's gift, the museums will comply with the irs
requirements and provide such information. the acceptance of an object at its appraised value does not imply
an endorsement of the appraisal by the museums. museums staff may, as a public service, provide an informal identification of an object to owners for their
personal information, provided that:
• the owner agrees to use such a service for educational purposes only;
• the service will not be used in connection with any past or contemplated commercial transaction;
• the owner understands that the service represents only an informal opinion by staff;
• and the rendition of such an opinion in no way implies or expresses authentication or value.
