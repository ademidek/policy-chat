withdrawn for academic reasons
if at the end of the semester of enrollment after being placed on academic probation, the student fails to meet
the minimum standard to return to good standing, the student will be withdrawn for academic reasons. at
least one full fall or spring term must elapse before a student withdrawn for academic reasons is eligible for
readmission. in addition, a student is withdrawn for academic reasons:
• may not enroll in a fall or spring term at the university during the period of academic withdrawal
• may not enroll in a summer term at the university without permission of the dean
• must apply for readmission
the above provisions notwithstanding, the dean of the student's college, in circumstances which seem to
warrant such action, may allow the student to continue as a full-time student on academic probation for a
single additional semester.
