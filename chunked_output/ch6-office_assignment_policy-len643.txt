members of the tenured or tenure-track faculty who are serving in full-time administrative leadership
positions (e.g., associate dean, associate provost) can expect to have an office or workspace assigned to
them in their administrative leadership office in addition to maintaining their existing department office. such
administrative offices will be suitable for the work, and shared, open, or less proximate space may be assigned
if the administrative office will not be in regular daily use. some faculty will need assignment of or access to specialized space (e.g., laboratory, studio) in order to
perform their research or creative work.
