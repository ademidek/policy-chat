the use of alcohol or drugs may, but does not automatically, affect a person's ability to consent to
sexual contact. the consumption of alcohol or drugs may result in incapacitation if the nature and
degree of the intoxication go beyond the stage of drunkenness, intoxication, or reduced inhibition to
the point where the individual is unable to make knowing, informed decisions or to understand the
nature and consequences of the sexual act. in such case, the person cannot consent to sexual activity,
regardless of their words or actions.
