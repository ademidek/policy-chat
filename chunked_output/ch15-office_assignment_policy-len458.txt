office fixtures and furnishings
standard office upgrades (paint, flooring, carpet, furniture) for approved new staff and faculty hires will be
made at the discretion of university facilities and funded by university facilities. such office upgrades will
ordinarily be completed only if they are on-cycle for the building, or part of the typical upgrade for a new
faculty member. office upgrades are typically not provided in the case of office reassignments.
