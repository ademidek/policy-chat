assessing a potential conflict of interest often depends on specific facts and circumstances, but, in general,
the university considers a conflict of interest to arise when:
• there are dual or multiple interests or loyalties, or the potential there for, that may inhibit the
exercise of objective or impartial judgment in furtherance of the mission and objectives of the
university or its affiliates; or
• a person in a position of authority over the university or its affiliates (e.g., covered persons)
may benefit financially from a decision he or she could make in such a capacity, including
indirect benefits such as to family members or businesses with which the person is closely
associated.
