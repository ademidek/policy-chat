when access to university facilities is required in connection with a commercially contracted project, the
project manager will coordinate the contractor's requirements with the director of one card services and
director of maintenance services before issuance of keys/cards to contractors by the facilities
department. the project manager will ensure that the contractors understand and agree to their
responsibilities (which are also outlined in the temporary key agreement issued by facilities)). upon
completion of their proof of the need for university keys/cards, the project manager and contractor will
ensure that the keys/cards are returned to the facilities management lock shop and one card services.
