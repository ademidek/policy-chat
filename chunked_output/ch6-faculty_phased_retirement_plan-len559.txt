in instances
where a faculty member's yearly teaching load is an odd number (for example 5 courses), the faculty
member must teach the larger share (e.g., 3) in the first year. an eligible faculty member may seek an
additional, third year of the transition period at the time the faculty member applies to participate in the
fprp. if the faculty member is approved for a third year of the transition period, then the faculty member
must perform at least 60% of their normal full-time faculty duties (in teaching, research, and service)
during such third year.
