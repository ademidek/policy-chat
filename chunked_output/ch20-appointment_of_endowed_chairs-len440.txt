the appointment to an endowed administrative chair is intended for the position, not the person. an
individual appointed to an endowed administrative chair will ordinarily hold such chair until the
conclusion of his or her term of service in that leadership position. if the chair holder leaves that
position to assume another role in the university, including as a member of the faculty, he or she will
relinquish the administrative chair.
