ongoing campus ministry leaders will be required to review and sign the
agreement (https://chaplaincy.richmond.edu/practice/ministries/covenant.html
) at the beginning of each
academic year. in addition to campus ministries and chaplaincy led programs, students may apply to form a religious or
spiritual registered student organization (rso) through the center for student involvement (csi) if an existing
program in the office of the chaplaincy can't meet a demonstrated need. students seeking to establish a
religious or spiritual rso must follow the standard processes for establishment of an rso.
