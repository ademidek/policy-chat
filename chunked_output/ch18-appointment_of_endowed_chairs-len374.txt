endowed administrative chairs may be held by individuals with faculty status when appropriate, but
the primary criterion for appointment is fitness for the administrative duties of the chair. the status of
previous incumbents does not dictate whether a chair holder should have faculty status; faculty status
is determined by the faculty as outlined in the faculty handbook.
