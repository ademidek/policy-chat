in general, the frequency and quality of meals and
entertainment expenses should be governed by what is reasonable and appropriate to the purpose involved. for the meal or entertainment expense to be allowable, the employee must provide the business purpose for
the expense, along with specific details including the names of the attendees, cost, date, and location of the
meal. for those meals where there are ten (10) or more individuals included in the meal and it is difficult to
determine who attended the event, the name of the department or organization and an estimate of the number
of individuals in attendance may be provided, rather than actual names.
