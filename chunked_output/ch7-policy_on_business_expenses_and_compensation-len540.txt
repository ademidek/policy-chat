even if such funds are allocated to a faculty-
designated account ("faculty development account"), such funds are not taxable to the employee and may not
be used to pay additional salary to the employee directing those funds. such professional development funds
("faculty development funds") typically expire at the end of the fiscal year, with the exception of start-up
funds and research incentive accounts. balances allocated to employees expire upon an employee's
separation from the university and shall not be paid out to an employee.
