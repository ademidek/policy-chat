proposals for new cross-school programs or related to existing programs affecting more than one school
must also be submitted to the deans of other affected schools. the dean must inform the office of institutional effectiveness that a recommendation to create,
modify, suspend or eliminate the program is being prepared, consistent with the university policy on
substantive change. (note: if the program to be suspended or eliminated is at an off-campus site
and is the only program offered at that site, then additional approval and documentation will be
required to close the site.
