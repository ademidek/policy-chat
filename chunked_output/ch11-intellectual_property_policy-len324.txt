for this reason, inventors
sometimes elect instead to protect an invention by relying on trade secret laws. when a patent application is filed, the u.s. patent and trademark office reviews it to ascertain if
the invention is new, useful and non-obvious and, if appropriate, grants a patent - usually two to
five years later.
