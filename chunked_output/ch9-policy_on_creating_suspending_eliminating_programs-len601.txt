acd-1605 – policy for creating, modifying, suspending or eliminating
academic programs
university of richmond | 3
faculty interested in creating a new academic program or significantly revising an existing program
should prepare a proposal for submission to the dean of the school in which the program will be
administratively housed and supported. cross-school programs must be situated in a school, generally
the one in which the principal faculty member who will coordinate the program is located. proposals to
suspend or eliminate a program will begin the process within the program's home school.
