time spent
working for the university as a casual/temporary employee or a faculty member with a
temporary and restricted appointment (as defined in the faculty handbook) will not count
toward the calculation of years of employment. for purposes of computing an employee's
years of employment, a period during which the employee is absent on an approved paid
leave of absence, or a faculty member with a continuing appointment is on an approved
sabbatical will be included when calculating years of employment. a period during which the
employee is absent on an approved unpaid leave of absence is not considered service with
the university for purposes of calculating years of employment.
