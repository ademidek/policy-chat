marijuana and other drugs
 marijuana
virginia law may allow certain marijuana related activities, such as limited medical marijuana
use and other recreational use and possession. however, using and possessing marijuana in
any form, including without limitation tinctures, edibles and topicals, remains a crime under
federal law. at the federal level, the controlled substances act criminalizes the growing
and use of marijuana, and it is well settled that federal enforcement agencies can
prosecute users and growers of marijuana.
