the preferred encryption strength is aes 256 bit or better. this can be achieved using
encrypted zip files. if the data is being transferred via web upload, the in-transit encryption should be
tls 1.2 (weak ciphers disabled) or tls 1.3.

2. the encryption key to the encrypted data must be transferred out of bounds. that is it cannot be
transferred using the same mechanism as the data.
