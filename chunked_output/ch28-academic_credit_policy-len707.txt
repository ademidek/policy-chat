for reference, here is how a credit hour is earned in a typical course, with 2550 minutes
being the standard per credit hour:
13 weeks x 55 minutes/credit hour of class = 715 minutes
13 weeks x 2 hours of out-of-class work = 1560 minutes
exam/credit hour of class = 60 minutes
preparing for exam = 215 minutes (or approximately 3.6 hours of preparation per hour of
exam)
for classes without a final exam or classes that meet outside of the typically scheduled 55
minutes/credit hour, these missing minutes can be achieved through additional out-of-class
work. 2. academic credit for independent research paper
students may receive one, two, or three-credits for preparing an independent research (ir)
paper.
