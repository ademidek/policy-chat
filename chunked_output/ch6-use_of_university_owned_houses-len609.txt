the presumption will be that a university house that becomes available will be advertised for sale to
full-time faculty and staff and sold according to the process outlined below. the university president,
however, may reserve a house that becomes available for a strategic institutional use rather than
making it available it for sale. such strategic institutional uses may include meeting academic or
student life programmatic needs, meeting administrative office space needs, serving as temporary
student housing, or providing an incentive to recruit or retain a university administrator or faculty
member.
