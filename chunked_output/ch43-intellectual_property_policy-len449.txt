3. the "immediate content" of a course includes both the ideas and the expression arising
extemporaneously as the course is actually taught and delivered to students in the
classroom (or otherwise at an assigned time or place), and this is so even when a
permanent record of the delivery of the course is simultaneously made (e.g., a videotaped
recording of a lecture). to this extent "the immediate content" of the course is subject to
the license.
