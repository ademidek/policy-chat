hrm-4004.1 – policy
the university's mission necessitates that most of its faculty and staff perform their work in richmond or in
the commonwealth of virginia. occasionally, however, the university may have a compelling business need
that can be met only by hiring or reassigning an employee to reside and perform their work outside of
virginia. the university reserves the right to determine whether, based on a compelling university business
need, it will permit an individual residing outside of virginia to become or continue to be employed by the
university.
