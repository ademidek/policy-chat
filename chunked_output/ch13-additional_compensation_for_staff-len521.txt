one-time payments for project or supplemental work
typically, one-time payments are appropriate for work performed that is distinctly different and unrelated to
the employee's primary position that occurs within a short period of time or irregularly. typically, non-exempt staff will be paid their hourly rate for any additional work. if, in rare circumstances, it
is determined that a non-exempt employee is eligible to receive a one-time payment, they must also be
compensated for any work over 40 hours in a work week.
