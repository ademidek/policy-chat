staff office assignments
assignment of staff work spaces will be aligned with the nature of the work; not all staff will have individual
offices or work stations. staff whose job responsibilities include welcoming visitors or serving as a first point
of contact will typically not be assigned an individual office. space allocation will be aligned with flexible
work arrangements; office-sharing and other kinds of arrangements will be implemented to maximize the use
of space among staff who regularly work remotely.
