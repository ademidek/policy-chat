upon
confirmation of military pay, the university will pay the difference between the employee's regular base
salary and base military pay for training and/or active duty. for purposes of this policy, regular base salary
is the salary that is received for the employee's primary position and does not include pay for additional or
secondary positions. alternatively, the employee may choose to use vacation time while on training or
active duty to receive full pay from the university in addition to the military pay.
