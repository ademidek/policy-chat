full-time
visiting faculty may be assigned a shared office, depending on space availability. adjunct faculty typically
will not be assigned an individual office, though they will be provided space that is appropriate for office
hours and other teaching needs. unpaid appointments, including courtesy appointments, retired faculty, and
emeritus faculty, will not be provided office space.
