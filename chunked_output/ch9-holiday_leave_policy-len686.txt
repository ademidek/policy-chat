working on a holiday:
if a university-observed holiday falls on a day when classes are in session or students are on campus or
when the university has work of an essential nature, employees may be required to work during a
scheduled holiday. department supervisors will decide if a department must provide services on holidays
and/or if an individual employee needs to work on the holiday. in such instances, if required to work on an official university holiday a non-exempt staff member will be:
• paid regular hours for the time worked; and
• paid whichever is greater- the holiday hours that equal the time worked or the employee's
eligible holiday hours (scheduled weekly hours/5).
