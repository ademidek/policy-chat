the university will make reasonable accommodations to employees who wish to observe religious
holidays not included in the holiday list above by allowing employees to take the day off. the university's
floating holidays and vacation leave allotments are designed to allow employees some flexibility to take
time off at their discretion (with supervisory approval) for such instances. regular full-time employees and part-time employees regularly scheduled to work at least 1,000 hours per
year are eligible for holiday pay.
