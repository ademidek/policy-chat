if a proposed program will not incorporate courses from more than one school and does not affect
another school then the proposal does not require review or recommendation from uapc or ufs. proposals for new or significant revisions to single-school degrees will be sent to uapc for its
awareness; no action on a single-school matter is required. it is at this stage that uapc would
consult with the provost regarding the possible need for review under the multi-school process, if
uapc determined that the proposed new or revised degree would affect multiple schools as
specified in the faculty senate charter.
