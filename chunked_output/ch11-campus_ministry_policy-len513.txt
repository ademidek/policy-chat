special care should
be taken to ensure that students are not advised or funded by off-campus advisors or outside
organizations. this is a key distinction between campus ministries, which are led by trained and
vetted religious life professionals, and rsos which must be student led and advised by a staff or
faculty member who is a current employee of the university. • religious and spiritual rsos must send a student representative (preferably president) to student
religious leadership council (srlc) meetings.
