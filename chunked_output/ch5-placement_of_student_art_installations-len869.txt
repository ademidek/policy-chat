• the proposed timing for the installation or exhibit will be reviewed by director of events for any
conflicts with existing university events or exhibits. • the evp and provost (or designee) will consult with the university space steward for that
campus space (as outlined in prm 1100 – policy on space allocation and facilities resources) as
well as the primary occupant of that campus space (e.g., dean in the case of academic buildings or
coordinate colleges, vp in the case of administrative spaces, athletic director in the case of
athletic spaces). in determining a response to student requests, the evp and provost may approve the installation, approve
with conditions (e.g., duration of the exhibit, safety precautions related to installation), recommend an
alternate space for the installation, or deny permission for an installation with a written rationale.
