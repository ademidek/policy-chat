coordination with pending criminal investigations
except in very unusual circumstances, the title ix investigation or formal resolution process will not
be delayed because of a pending criminal investigation. when an incident is reported to both the
university police and the title ix coordinator, they will share information to the extent possible and
as appropriate and will seek to avoid unnecessary burdens on the complainant or respondent. in certain situations, law enforcement officials may request that the title ix coordinator temporarily
suspend an investigation or formal resolution process while law enforcement officials gather evidence
in a criminal investigation.
