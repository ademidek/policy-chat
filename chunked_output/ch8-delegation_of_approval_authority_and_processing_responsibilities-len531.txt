delegations that are more frequent or for longer periods of time must be discussed with and approved by the
university controller for financial transactions or the relevant vice president for other types of transactions. if an employee has plans to be away from the university for five or more days, approval responsibilities
should be delegated to ensure that university business transactions are not delayed as a result of an absence. a delegate has the same responsibilities as the approver and is acting in the approver's name.
