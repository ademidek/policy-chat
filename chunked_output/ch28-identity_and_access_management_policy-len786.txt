local accounts and authorizations: when accounts or authorizations are created outside of the
central enterprise authentication system, the operational department creating the accounts must
define a mechanism to deprovision the accounts in a timely fashion (generally within a few
business days unless a specific time frame is requested) and consistent with the conditions
expressed in the associated
user life cycle standard. note: deprovisioning local accounts must occur promptly upon role change, separation, or
termination. it is insufficient to rely on central deprovisioning of accounts as a method of
terminating locally deployed authorizations, as the timeliness of account deprovisioning is
dependent on factors that are beyond the control of local application administrators.
