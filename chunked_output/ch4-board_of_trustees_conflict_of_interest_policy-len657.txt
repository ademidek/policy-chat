as used in this policy, a "business relationship"
among covered persons occurs when:
• one covered person is employed by another in a sole proprietorship or by an organization for
which another covered person serves as trustee, director, officer, key employee or of which
another covered person owns greater than a 35% interest; or
• one covered person is transacting business with another covered person (other than in the
ordinary course of either party's business on the same terms as are generally offered to the
public), directly or indirectly where the transaction(s) has a value in excess of $10,000 in the
aggregate during the university's tax year.
