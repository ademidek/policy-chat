if unforeseen circumstances prevent essential non-exempt staff from reporting to work during an early
dismissal, cancellation or delayed opening, they must call in prior to the start of their shift (based on
departmental guidelines for providing advance notice). if approved, pay for this time taken will be considered
inclement weather pay. if there is no advance notice, then normal departmental pay procedures will apply.
