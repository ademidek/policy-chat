university facilities and information services must be notified of the need for moving
assistance at least 12 weeks prior to a planned move date. reassignment of a current employee into a vacated
office should typically be limited to one move (i.e., employees within an entire department should not all
move to different offices because of one vacancy). more complex reassignment / reorganization of office
space within a unit must be requested as part of the annual facilities project plan process.
