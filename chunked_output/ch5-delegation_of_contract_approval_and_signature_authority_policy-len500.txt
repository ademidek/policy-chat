contract approval
contract approval is the process of approving or rejecting requests for contracts and contract terms and
conditions. contract approval authority is not contract signature authority. individuals with the authority to
approve contracts are responsible for:
• determining the business need for the contract,
• reading and understanding the contract,
• ensuring the contract, as written, addresses the university's business need, and
• approving or rejecting the key terms of contracts.
