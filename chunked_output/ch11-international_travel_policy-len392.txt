if students refuse to comply with an evacuation, ur may withdraw financial support and may institute
disciplinary action. this could result in financial loss, such as a required repayment of financial aid. if an evacuation is deemed necessary, it may not be possible to recover costs that students have paid
and/or to refund such costs to students for travel as well as the evacuation itself.
