staff compensation for instructing academic courses
a staff employee whose position does not include teaching responsibilities may be allowed to teach up to one
undergraduate or graduate course per term and a total of two courses per year with approval from their vp or
dean. the staff member must have the appropriate academic qualifications for teaching (acd-7201
academic and professional preparation requirements for faculty) and their teaching must be evaluated by
the hiring school by the same method used to evaluate adjunct instructors. compensation for this additional
work should be similar to that of an adjunct faculty for comparable instruction.
