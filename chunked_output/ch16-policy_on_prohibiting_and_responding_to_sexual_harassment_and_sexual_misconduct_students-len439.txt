the term "consent" means clear and unambiguous agreement to engage in sexual activity as
evidenced by words or actions that demonstrate a knowing and voluntary willingness to engage in
mutually agreed upon sexual activity. consent cannot be gained by force, duress, intimidation,
coercion, ignoring objections, or taking advantage of another's incapacitation. consent cannot be
inferred from silence or any other lack of active resistance.
