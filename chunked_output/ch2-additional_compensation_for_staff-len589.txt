appropriate additional compensation for the nature
of these assignments will be determined by human resources in consultation with the employee's manager
and on a case-by-case basis. an exempt employee, by the nature of their position, is considered to be available for work assignments
without additional remuneration at times other than their regularly scheduled hours. however, there are
circumstances when additional compensation may be appropriate when the additional work is significantly
over and above the employee's job responsibilities or distinct and separate from those duties.
