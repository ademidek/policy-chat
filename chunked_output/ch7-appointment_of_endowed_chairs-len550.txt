in certain circumstances and only with the written approval of the provost, distinguished visiting
faculty may hold an endowed faculty chair when it is in the university's interest to do so and it is not
inconsistent with the intentions expressed by the donor in the supporting gift documentation. an
appointment to an endowed chair for a visitor is normally for a period of one academic year, but may
be for a shorter period. school and university procedures for appointment of visitors will be followed
in making visitor endowed chair appointments.
