the costs of preparing labs or other specialized research space for faculty will be shared by university
facilities and the hiring school as follows: specialized equipment, whether movable or affixed in a room,
and the direct costs of changes to infrastructure required to accommodate that equipment will be paid by the
school (e.g., specialized research computing equipment or servers, purchase of specialized ventilation hoods,
soundproofing, specialized lighting or audio, installation costs if outside vendor contract is required). general
infrastructure needs that are deemed necessary per university standards and performed by university
facilities will be covered as part of the university facilities budget (e.g., furniture, shelving, paint, flooring,
plumbing).
