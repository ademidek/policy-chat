the university is the owner of all administrative data; individual units or departments have stewardship
responsibilities for portions of that data. information maintained on university systems is a vital asset that
will be available only to those who have a legitimate business need to access it in order to conduct
university business. the university does not allow the use of administrative data for anything but the
conduct of university business.
