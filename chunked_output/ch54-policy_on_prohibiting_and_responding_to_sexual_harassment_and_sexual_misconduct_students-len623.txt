supportive measures. the term "supportive measures" means individualized measures offered as
appropriate and as reasonably available to a complainant, respondent, or witness, without fee or charge,
designed to: (1) restore or preserve the individual's equal access to the university's education programs and
activity or to protect the safety of the individuals or the campus community; or (2) provide support during an
investigation, formal resolution process, or alternative resolution process under this policy. supportive
measures are non-disciplinary and non-punitive and should not unreasonably burden the other party.
