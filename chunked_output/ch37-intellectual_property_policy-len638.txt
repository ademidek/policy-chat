faculty: subject to section c below and in contrast to the general "work for hire" doctrine, the
university recognizes the longstanding academic tradition of allowing faculty members the right
to own their copyrightable works. in such cases, faculty shall be deemed to automatically grant
to the university a non- exclusive, royalty-free perpetual license to materials that are developed
for university courses or curriculum for all traditional, customary or reasonable academic uses of
the material (see section c below for more details). however, the general rule regarding faculty
ownership will be subject to the following exceptions.
