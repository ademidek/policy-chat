those fees may be paid from university budgets allocated for marketing
purposes and decisions about allocating funds for marketing may be made at the discretion of an

• membership fees for professional organizations in which it is important that the institution, a
school, or program be a member (e.g., ace, aals) or subscriptions or fees in exchange for access
to data or services (e.g., the phd project);
• payment of a reasonable fee to an entity for providing a service to the university in support of its
academic mission (e.g., an organization making a lab accessible to students or making available an
executive or staff member for a lecture or conversation with students); and
• modest memorial gifts made by the chaplaincy in instances in which flowers from the university
would normally be sent, but the family has indicated a strong preference for memorial gifts in lieu
of flowers.
