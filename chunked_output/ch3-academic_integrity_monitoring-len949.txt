the registrar will provide a report at least annually to the provost and director of athletics, reviewing
the academic integrity of the university's programs, particularly with respect to student-athletes, and
highlighting any areas of concern. the report will also be shared at least annually with: the deans of the
undergraduate schools, the assistant athletic director for compliance, the assistant athletic director
for academics, the faculty athletics representative (far), the faculty athletic committee, and the
relevant committee(s) of the board of trustees (which are at present the athletic committee and the
academic and enrollment management committee, and which may be determined at the board's
discretion without requiring revision to the policy). the office of internal audit may also review the
report at periodic intervals it deems appropriate.
