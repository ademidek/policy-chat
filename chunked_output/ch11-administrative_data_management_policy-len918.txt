irm-4007 – administrative data management policy
university of richmond | 3
individually identifiable data shall be available to the extent necessary to perform administrative tasks;
unit record data will be provided only when aggregate data or other alternatives cannot effectively meet
the business need. the data management committee is responsible for ensuring that procedures are
developed by functional offices to address those cases in which a member of the university community
seeks permission to access administrative data beyond that which is needed for the normal
performance of their duties. because no computer system is completely immune from unauthorized access or attempted access
(e.g., "hacking"), applying layered security controls (e.g., multiple levels of access permissions) will
better safeguard university computers and our ever-expanding body of administrative data, which is
often sensitive.
