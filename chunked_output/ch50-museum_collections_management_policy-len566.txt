if the museums efforts to return objects within a
reasonable period following the termination of the loan are unsuccessful, then the objects will be maintained
at the lender's risk and expense for a maximum of one year. if after one year the objects have not been
claimed, then the lender/owner shall be deemed to have made the objects an unrestricted gift to the museums
as defined by state law (code of virginia §55-210). upon termination of a loan, the lender is on notice that a return or renewal must be affected, or else a gift of
the objects will be inferred.
