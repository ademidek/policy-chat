approvers with different types of approval responsibilities should assign each type of responsibility to the
most appropriate delegate, even if that results in having multiple delegates during an absence. for transactions related to grants, a principal investigator may only delegate approval to someone with first-
hand knowledge of the research/project that the grant is funding (e.g. a lab manager or post-doc working on
the same project).
