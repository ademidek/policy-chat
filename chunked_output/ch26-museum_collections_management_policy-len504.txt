the museums may also practice selective acquisition, which means that the museum may choose to accept
only certain objects that are part of a larger gift and reject others that do not conform to the museum's
collecting standards. in the case of a gift, objects not accepted for the permanent collection (i.e., non-accessioned works) may be
considered for the education collection with the donor's approval. it is understood that the use of these items may result in their deterioration or loss over time.
