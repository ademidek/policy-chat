it is the intent
of the university to remain open and adhere to full operations, including normal class schedules,
whenever possible. commuting students, faculty, and staff should always exercise their best judgment
with regard to road conditions and other safety concerns. if weather conditions or other emergencies make it impossible to maintain an ordinary level of on campus
academic activity and business functions, the university may alter the daily schedule.
