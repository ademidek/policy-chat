if an employee becomes ineligible for the cell phone allowance (due to a change in jobs, change in job duties,
separation from the university, etc.), any fees associated with the device, remaining service contract charges,
or service contract change or cancellation fees are the responsibility of the employee. if there are problems with service or the device, the employee will need to work directly with their service
provider for resolution. the university cannot accept any liability for claims, charges, or disputes between the
employee and the service provider.
