in rare circumstances, non-essential, non-exempt staff may be required by their manager to work on campus or remotely
to ensure that time-sensitive or urgent tasks are completed. in such circumstances, these employees will receive
inclement weather pay, equivalent to their regular pay rate, in addition to their regular pay for any hours worked. non-exempt non-essential staff who choose to physically report to work when the university's normal on-campus
schedule is suspended are not entitled to inclement weather pay but will receive regular pay.
