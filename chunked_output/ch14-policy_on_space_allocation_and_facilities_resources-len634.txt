university facilities are maintained and renovated based on a multi-year facilities project plan to ensure
consistently high-quality facilities and resources. the facilities project plan is guided by the university
strategic plan, the university campus plan, the classroom master plan, and the regular facilities condition
assessments. vice presidents, deans and space stewards are expected to identify emerging facilities needs
in their area and prioritize their requests for facilities projects as part of the annual call for project requests.
