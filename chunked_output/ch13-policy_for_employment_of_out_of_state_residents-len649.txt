no offer shall be made to an out-of-state candidate until the manager has received approval to
hire in that state (either as a pre-approval or through step 1(b) above). if an employee is approved to work in a state that is not on the pre-approved list, the employee's
start date will be delayed until the university completes all necessary steps to be in compliance
with that state's laws and regulations. note that for states not already on the approved list or
states on the approved list but where the university has not yet registered to accommodate
employees, it may take 8-12 weeks for the university's application to be reviewed and approved.
