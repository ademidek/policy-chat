university officials, decide whether an investigation is warranted under the criteria set forth in 42 cfr §

provided to ori, together with a copy of the inquiry report meeting the requirements of 42 cfr § 93.309,
within 30 days of the finding. if it is found that an investigation is not warranted, the do and the rio will
ensure that detailed documentation of the inquiry is retained for at least 7 years after termination of the
inquiry, so that ori may assess the reasons why the university decided not to conduct an investigation.
