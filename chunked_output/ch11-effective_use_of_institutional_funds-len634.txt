university of richmond | 3
the president, deans and vice presidents may receive donor restricted funds intended to be used at their
discretion to support special programs or initiatives. as such, it is permissible to leave some portion of these
discretionary funds unspent for a reasonable period of time, in order to create flexibility for these
opportunities. spending plans for these funds should be developed in consultation with the office of planning
and budget, and the executive vice-president & provost or the executive vice-president & chief operating
office, as appropriate.
