university of richmond | 3
permissions: specific operations or actions that an authenticated user or entity is allowed to perform on a
resource or system. permissions are a fundamental part of authorization, which determines what an
authenticated user can do, after authentication verifies who they are. permissions are typically assigned to
roles, which are then assigned to users, creating a system of access control.
