during the proposal
preparation process, faculty intending to seek an exception should alert the office of foundation,
corporate and government relations, so that their request and justification may be routed accordingly. note: private funding agencies may allow direct charges for f&a costs otherwise not allowed by federal
agencies. in this case, faculty members are encouraged to include f&a under the direct cost section of the
proposed budget.
