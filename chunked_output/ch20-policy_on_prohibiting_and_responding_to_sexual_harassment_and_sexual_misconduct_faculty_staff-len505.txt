consent may be withdrawn at any time through clear words or actions such as walking or running
away, pushing the other party away, or attempting to physically stop the other party. once a person
withdraws consent, sexual activity must stop, regardless of the extent or nature of the sexual behavior
that has occurred up to the moment that consent is withdrawn. for example, if one individual clearly
says "no" and the other continues penetration or another form of sexual contact, it is sexual
misconduct.
