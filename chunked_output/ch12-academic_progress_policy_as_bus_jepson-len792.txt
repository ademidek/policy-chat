readmission to the university
students who have withdrawn from the university for whatever reason, other than participating in an
approved study abroad, exchange, or visiting away program, and wish to return must make their request for
readmission in writing by the deadline, typically february 15 for readmission for the summer or fall terms and
october 1 for readmission to the spring term. applications for readmission will be evaluated by a committee
including the richmond and westhampton college deans, the senior associate registrar, the avp and director
of financial aid, and the relevant associate dean from the jepson school of leadership studies or the robins
school of business, for students who are majoring in that school.
