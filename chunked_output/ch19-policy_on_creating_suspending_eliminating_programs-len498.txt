after the proposed program change has been approved by the provost (or trustees for a new or
eliminated degree), the office of institutional effectiveness will notify, and if necessary, seek
approval from sacscoc. in addition to sacscoc, an individual school or program may need to
seek approval from the program accrediting body if applicable (e.g., aacsb, aba, caep). proposals to create, suspend or eliminate a degree program must be approved by the board of
trustees prior to notifying sacscoc.
