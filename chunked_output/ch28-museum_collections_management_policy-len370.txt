museums will not acquire undocumented rocks, fossils, flora, or fauna, including human remains. all additions to the museums collections are carefully considered and evaluated. acquisitions support the
mission of the university and the role of the museums in serving the faculty, staff, and students of the
university community and outreach to the greater community.
