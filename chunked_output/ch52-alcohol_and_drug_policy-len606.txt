federal law makes the distribution of "analogue" substances
marketed for human consumption illegal if those substances are chemically similar to scheduled
illegal drugs and have the same pharmacological effects on the user. the penalties vary based on
many factors, including the type and amount of drug involved and whether there is intent to
distribute. federal law holds that any person who distributes, possesses with intent to distribute, or
manufactures a controlled substance within one thousand feet of an educational facility is subject to
doubling of the applicable maximum punishments and fines.
