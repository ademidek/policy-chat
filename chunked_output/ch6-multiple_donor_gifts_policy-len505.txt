gift fund creation
 group gifts creating a new gift fund are subject to the same rules of other new pending gift funds. if,
within one (1) year of the specified pledge period, the value of the fund is less than the required
minimum, the funds may either a) be transferred to an existing fund for a related purpose that will
most closely accomplish the donor's intent, or b) create a new gift fund of a different type with a
lower established minimum. this option would require updated gift documentation.
