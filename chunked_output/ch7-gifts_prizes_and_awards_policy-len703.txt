to show appreciation for or recognize a staff member's outstanding service to the university, supervisors are
encouraged to recommend an employee for a bonus payment or other recognition through one of the
university's formal recognition programs administered through human resources. the use of university resources to provide gifts in recognition of employee service milestones such as
retirement or departure of long-serving employees is permissible and must be coordinated with human
resources to ensure compliance with tax requirements. the use of university resources to provide gifts in recognition of holidays or personal events (e.g., weddings,
birthdays, or births/adoptions) is not permitted.
