occasionally, however,
because of the way the systems identify and handle problems, information services personnel may not
avoid observing the contents of email and other files. these personnel shall peruse these emails and/or
stored files as little as possible in order to perform the necessary task. if information services staff
must access user content, they shall treat the information or content with strict confidentiality and
notify the account holder of the incident, except in the case where it is evidence for violations of the
law or written university policy.
