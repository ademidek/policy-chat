prm-2001 – policy for management and use of university-owned houses
university of richmond | 2
background
the university has, since shortly after its move to its present campus in 1914, offered to faculty and staff
(tenants) arrangements for residence in houses located on the university's campus. although the legal and
economic details of the arrangements have changed somewhat from time to time (as a result of changes in
tax laws, changes in the residential real estate market and other reasons), the essential nature of the
arrangements has remained unchanged. the intent of the university has always been to maintain a program under which, in effect, the tenant
"buys" his or her house (but not land) from the university and the university "re- purchases" it at the end
of the arrangement in accordance with a formula that allows the two parties (university and tenant) to
share in the appreciation in the value of the house (but not land).
