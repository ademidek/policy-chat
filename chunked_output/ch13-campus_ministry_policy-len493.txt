however, the chaplaincy and the university of richmond do not sanction the
activities of unrecognized religious organizations. students are strongly advised to use caution when joining
an unrecognized organization. unrecognized groups are not monitored for compliance with important university policies, such as those
related to non-discrimination, harassment, and hazing, and their staff do not complete the mandatory training
required of other staff, faculty, and campus ministry volunteers.
