reassignment of office space
when a space is vacated, particularly non-standard faculty offices, it may be appropriate for the vacated office
to be occupied by an existing employee, rather than the department's next new hire. in those instances, the
resulting space reassignments must be developed in collaboration with university facilities and approved by
the university space manager. typically, such approval should be sought at the same time approval is sought
to hire the replacement staff or faculty member; in situations in which the vacancy will not be filled, the office
space reassignment must be approved by the university space manager before it is announced or the timeline
for moves established.
