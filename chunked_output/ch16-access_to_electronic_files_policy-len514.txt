systems are routinely "backed up" to protect system
reliability and integrity as well as to prevent potential loss of data. the back-up process results in the copying
of data onto storage media that may be retained for periods of time and in locations unknown to the originator
or recipient of the email. no guarantee of confidentiality – information services staff follow sound professional practices in
providing for the security of the email, data, application programs, and system programs under their control.
