exceptions:
philanthropic gifts are exempt from this policy. grants made by funding agencies, both public and private,
with policies explicitly stating that they do not pay f&a costs will also be exempt from this policy. faculty seeking an exception to the university's standard indirect cost recovery policy must receive
approval from both the evp and provost and the evp and chief operating officer.
