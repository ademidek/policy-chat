course levels are determined by the department offering a course at the time that the course is proposed. the
sequencing of courses in a program is taken into account in determining course level and designing the
program (major, minor, or concentration) so that students are learning progressively more advanced materials
with deeper and more complex assignments that allow them to grow in their skills and that demonstrate
advancement in a field of study.

acd-1606 – course level policy
university of richmond | 2
course numbers at the 100- and 200-level serve as introductory or general education courses. they are meant
to introduce students to a discipline, including key concepts and terms. 200-level courses may involve a
deeper investigation or more narrowly defined content. courses at the 100- and 200-level are intended
primarily for first- and second-year students. they generally do not have prerequisites or restrictions but serve
as prerequisites for upper-level coursework.
course numbers in the 300- and 400-range generally serve as upper-level courses or specialized electives
within a major or minor and may have one or more prerequisites. they typically involve the integration of
skills and knowledge from 100- and 200-level courses. students deepen their knowledge and consider more
challenging material. 300- and 400-level courses typically involve more independent work, either individually
or collaboratively, than lower-level courses. courses at the 300- or 400-level are usually taken by juniors and
seniors. 400-level courses are often the capstone or senior thesis for a major or minor.
at the graduate level, courses are numbered in the 500s, 600s and 700s. all graduate schools use 500-level
numbers, the school of professional and continuing studies and school of law use 600-level numbers, and
the school of law uses 700-level numbers. introductory courses for a program are in the low 500 numbers
and more advanced coursework in the upper 500 numbers and 600 numbers. 700-level courses are generally
advanced seminars or practica.
