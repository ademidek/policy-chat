policy statement:
irm-4006.1 – definitions
the gdpr defines (a) "personal data" as information that identifies an individual, or may be used to identify
an individual, such as name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or factors specific to
the individual's physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity, (b) "sensitive
personal data" as information that relates to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade
union activities, physical or mental health, sexual life, or details of criminal offences. (c) "controller" as the
entity that determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, (d) "processor" as the entity
that processes personal data on behalf of the controller, and (e) "data subject" as a natural person who is
identified, or can be identified, by reference to his or her personal data.
irm-4006.2 – data protection officer
richmond is not a public authority or body. at present, richmond's core activities do not include the regular
and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale, nor does it process on a large scale either special
categories of data (as described in gdpr article 9) or personal data relating to criminal convictions and
offenses (as described in gdpr article 10). for these reasons, richmond is not subject to the gdpr
requirement to designate a data protection officer ("dpo"). if, in the future, richmond voluntarily designates
a dpo, this notice shall be updated to identify and include contact information for the dpo.
irm-4006.3 – the identity and contact details of the controller
under the gdpr, richmond, in most cases, will be deemed the "controller" of an individual's personal data.
to contact richmond in its capacity as controller, please direct all questions and concerns to
gdpr@richmond.edu
.
irm-4006.4 – richmond's purpose and legal basis for processing personal data
richmond will only process personal data for lawful purposes under the gdpr related to richmond's
charitable, educational, and scientific purposes and arising from: (a) the individual's relationship with
richmond as a prospective, current, or former student (or such a student's parent or guardian), faculty or staff
member, contractor, donor, research subject, or visitor to richmond or attending a richmond event; or (b) an
individual's use of or access to richmond's website(s).
richmond will ordinarily collect and process personal data because it has legitimate interest in doing so or is
fulfilling its rights and obligations under a contract to which the individual is a party. when richmond
cannot rely on either of such legal grounds, it will seek an individual's prior consent.
the purposes for which richmond collects personal data, and the legal bases for processing such personal
data, are summarized in the chart that appears below.

in the chart, each reference to (a) richmond's "legitimate interest" shall require a determination by
richmond that its legitimate interest in processing personal data is not overridden by an individual's interest

of a contract" shall be deemed to mean, "necessary for the performance of a contract or agreement to which
an individual is a party, or preliminary steps leading up to such a contract or agreement;" (c) "prior consent"
shall mean an individual's voluntarily consent, given prior to the processing of any personal data.
