display their artwork must contact the faculty or staff member responsible for that space.
the student request for either exhibit or installation in a non-gallery space will be made in writing to the
provost and include:
• an image and description of the proposed installation, including its size and materials
• the proposed schedule for the installation (including set-up and take-down, as necessary)

unless mutually agreed to prior to approval of the installation
• must conform to fire safety and other building codes

the student request, with faculty recommendation, will be sent to the executive vice president and
provost, who will develop a response in consultation with the senior associate vice president for campus
operations.
• the proposed timing for the installation or exhibit will be reviewed by director of events for any
conflicts with existing university events or exhibits.
• the evp and provost (or designee) will consult with the university space steward for that
campus space (as outlined in prm 1100 – policy on space allocation and facilities resources) as
well as the primary occupant of that campus space (e.g., dean in the case of academic buildings or
coordinate colleges, vp in the case of administrative spaces, athletic director in the case of
athletic spaces).
in determining a response to student requests, the evp and provost may approve the installation, approve
with conditions (e.g., duration of the exhibit, safety precautions related to installation), recommend an
alternate space for the installation, or deny permission for an installation with a written rationale.
the decision of the evp and provost is final.
student art installations that are placed in non-gallery spaces without securing approval as outlined in this
policy are subject to removal by the university. the university is not responsible for any damage that
occurs to student art installations in non-gallery spaces.
