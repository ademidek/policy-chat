policy statement:
fin-4409.1 – definitions
contract
a contract is a binding commitment by or on behalf of the university that is in oral or written form, regardless
of the title of the operative document or documents. for purposes of this policy, the term "contract" includes
but is not limited to contracts, agreements, leases, memoranda of understanding ("mou"), gift agreements,
mutual aid agreements, settlement agreements, resolution agreements, letter agreements, and binding letters of
intent.
this policy and the related policies referenced below must be followed when creating, approving, signing, and
managing contracts.
contract approval
contract approval is the process of approving or rejecting requests for contracts and contract terms and
conditions. contract approval authority is not contract signature authority. individuals with the authority to
approve contracts are responsible for:
• determining the business need for the contract,
• reading and understanding the contract,
• ensuring the contract, as written, addresses the university's business need, and
• approving or rejecting the key terms of contracts.
individuals with authority to approve contracts are also responsible for ensuring compliance with any other
review and approval procedures required by this policy or the university's contract management and
procurement policies, including conducting a competitive bid process, when required, and obtaining any
required legal, risk management or information services review.
contract signature
contract signature is the process of approving or rejecting proposed contract terms and conditions and
signing approved contracts. individuals granted contract signature authority under this policy are
responsible for:
• approving or rejecting the key terms of contracts, and
• signing approved contracts within their respective scope of signature authority.
fin-4409.2 – overview

be read in conjunction with the policies listed in the related policies and procedures section of this document.
fin-4409.3 – contracts requiring board of trustee approval
