hrm-2008 – holiday leave policy
university of richmond | 2
• six days of winter break (dates vary and do not apply to weekend dates: typically december 24th
through december 31st)
• two floating holidays (to be used within the calendar year). floating holidays are first effective on
7/1/25, with two days granted to be used by 12/31/25. effective 1/1/26, employees will receive two
floating holidays each calendar year.
the university will make reasonable accommodations to employees who wish to observe religious
holidays not included in the holiday list above by allowing employees to take the day off. the university's
floating holidays and vacation leave allotments are designed to allow employees some flexibility to take
time off at their discretion (with supervisory approval) for such instances.
regular full-time employees and part-time employees regularly scheduled to work at least 1,000 hours per
year are eligible for holiday pay. full-time employees who work less than 12 months will not receive
holidays during their time away. part-time employees regularly scheduled to work at least 1,000 hours per
year are eligible for holiday pay based on a pro-rated basis. only hours worked on an observed holiday
will be credited toward overtime calculations.
to qualify for holiday pay, an employee must be in an approved pay status the scheduled day before and
the scheduled day after the holiday. in addition, the employee must meet (or be officially excused from)
their last assigned work shift prior to the holiday and meet (or be officially excused from) the next
assigned work shift following the holiday.
holiday hours will be paid based on scheduled total weekly hours divided by 5. no holiday pay is granted
when a holiday occurs during leave without pay, during an unpaid leave of absence, parental leave, while
on layoff status, or on a suspension. while an employee is receiving short term disability (std)
payments, the payment of the holiday will be paid at 66 2/3% consistent with std payments.
an employee's last day of employment must be an active workday and not a holiday.
working on a holiday:
if a university-observed holiday falls on a day when classes are in session or students are on campus or
when the university has work of an essential nature, employees may be required to work during a
scheduled holiday. department supervisors will decide if a department must provide services on holidays
and/or if an individual employee needs to work on the holiday.
in such instances, if required to work on an official university holiday a non-exempt staff member will be:
• paid regular hours for the time worked; and
• paid whichever is greater- the holiday hours that equal the time worked or the employee's
eligible holiday hours (scheduled weekly hours/5).
when operationally feasible, a non-exempt/hourly employee who is required to work on a holiday may
take an alternate day off during the same work week.
exempt staff who are required to work during a scheduled holiday will receive regular pay only. when
operationally feasible, an exempt employee required to work during a holiday will be granted an alternate
day off within the same pay period.
employees working 12 hour rotating shifts in departments with 365-day staffing (except for
