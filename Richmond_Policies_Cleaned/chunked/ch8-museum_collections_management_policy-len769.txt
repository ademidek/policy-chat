museums serve the university's students and community, the greater richmond area, and statewide,
national, and international audiences. the museums provide the opportunity for the appreciation,
knowledge, and scholarship of art, cultural history, and science through the collections, exhibitions (on-
campus and traveling), and scholarly publications. academic and public programs include special courses,
lectures, gallery talks, artists' residencies, workshops, concerts, symposia, and other events. the
collections of the three museums include approximately 100,000 objects, ranging from gemstones and
shells, to decorative arts and artifacts from many cultures, to prints from the renaissance to the present, to
contemporary paintings and sculpture
