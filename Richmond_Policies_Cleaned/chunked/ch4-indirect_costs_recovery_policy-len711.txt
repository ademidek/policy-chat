. it is the university's policy to
recover the full amount of indirect costs allowable by a granting agency, whether public or private.
the university periodically negotiates a federal f&a reimbursement rate with the u.s. department of
health and human services. the university of richmond's current f&a cost rate, applied to salaries,
wages, and fringe benefits, is 52 percent on campus and 23 percent off campus, which is used if more than
50 percent of a project is performed off campus. faculty who are preparing proposals should contact the
office of foundation, corporate and government relations to verify this rate, which is subject to change.
