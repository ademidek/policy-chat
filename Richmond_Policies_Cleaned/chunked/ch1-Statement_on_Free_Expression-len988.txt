rsity of richmond is committed to the production and dissemination of knowledge
through open inquiry and "the promotion of a vibrant intellectual community that encourages
thoughtful disagreement and the vigorous exchange of ideas." 1 the university believes that
"respectful engagement with a broad diversity of perspectives and experiences [is] essential to
intellectual growth,"2 and that members of the university community can build understanding and
empathy by engaging with different points of view. the university's commitment to fostering a
diverse, inclusive community demands an equally strong commitment to freedom of expression.
the ability to speak freely, debate vigorously, and engage deeply with differing viewpoints is
essential to the university's mission of advancing knowledge and preparing students to flourish in
a complex world
