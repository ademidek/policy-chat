. immediate actions
any individual who has experienced sexual harassment/sexual misconduct that may constitute a crime, is
encouraged to do the following as promptly as possible, in order to preserve evidence that may assist in
proving that the alleged offense occurred or may be helpful in obtaining a protective order:
o get to a safe place as soon as possible.
o try to preserve all physical evidence. do not wash clothes or use the toilet. put all clothing you
were wearing at the time of the incident in a paper bag, not in a plastic bag. all physical
evidence should be provided to police as soon as possible.

needed
