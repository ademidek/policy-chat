deeper investigation or more narrowly defined content. courses at the 100- and 200-level are intended
primarily for first- and second-year students. they generally do not have prerequisites or restrictions but serve
as prerequisites for upper-level coursework.
course numbers in the 300- and 400-range generally serve as upper-level courses or specialized electives
within a major or minor and may have one or more prerequisites. they typically involve the integration of
skills and knowledge from 100- and 200-level courses. students deepen their knowledge and consider more
challenging material. 300- and 400-level courses typically involve more independent work, either individually
or collaboratively, than lower-level courses. courses at the 300- or 400-level are usually taken by juniors and
seniors. 400-level courses are often the capstone or senior thesis for a major or minor.
at the graduate level, courses are numbered in the 500s, 600s and 700s
