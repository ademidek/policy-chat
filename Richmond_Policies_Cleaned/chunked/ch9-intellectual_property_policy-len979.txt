. in most foreign countries, however, this one-year grace
period does not exist. in many countries, foreign patent rights may be lost immediately upon the

b. what is a trade secret?
trade secrets are defined and protected under various state laws. these laws protect secret
business information against unauthorized use or disclosure by one who obtained the information
through improper means or through a confidential relationship. a trade secret consists of
information that: (a) derives economic value from not being generally known to others, and (b) is
the subject of reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy. information generally known to the
public or easily learned by proper means is not a trade secret. trade secrets may be used to
protect forms of intellectual property which do not readily fall under the scope of trademark,
copyright or patent law protections
