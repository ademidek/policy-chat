. traditional undergraduate schools
the three traditional undergraduate schools, the school of arts and sciences, the robins school of
business, and the jepson school of leadership studies, moved to a system of "units" beginning in fall
2008. in these schools, an undergraduate unit is based on "time-on-task" as a standard and recognizes
10-14 hours per week as the minimum time that a typical good student should need to spend on a
course, if that course is sufficiently challenging and if that student is to achieve a high level of
learning, as measured by intended learning objectives
