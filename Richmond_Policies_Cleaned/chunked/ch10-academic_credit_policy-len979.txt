. credit may be rounded in cases where doing so is necessary to provide
a comparable amount of credit (e.g. if a student was enr olled in a full-time load of four 3-
semester hour courses while studying abroad, those courses would be rounded up to 0.9
units so the total would equate to a full-time load at richmond which is 3.5 units).
c. credit by examination: credit earned by examination is awarded based on the demonstration of
proficiency and may be used to satisfy requirements in the same manner as the college courses
which the tests replace, or as the academic department concerned might specify. credit earned by
examination will not be awarded for the same course more than once. students may also be
exempt from a course based on an examination score as approved by the appropriate academic
department. exemption will meet an individual requirement but will not be eligible for the
transfer of credit.
