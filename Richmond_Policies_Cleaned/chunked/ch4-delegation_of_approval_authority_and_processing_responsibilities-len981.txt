. only authorized university employees (i.e., "approvers") have the authority to obligate the
university to receive or spend funds, provide or receive services, or otherwise commit institutional resources.
university employees with approval authority are expected to exercise good judgement in evaluating the
reasonableness of transactions in light of university policies and procedures, and sound business practices.
delegation of approval responsibilities
approvers may temporarily delegate the authority to perform administrative approval responsibilities on their
behalf to a delegate, as described in this policy. the delegate selected by the approver must have the requisite
knowledge and skill set to be able to evaluate the proposed transactions or activities effectively. additionally,
the proposed delegation must not place the delegate in a position of approving their own transactions or those
initiated by their approver (see "segregation of duties" discussion, below)
