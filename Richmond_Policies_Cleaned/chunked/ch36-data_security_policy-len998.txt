university administrative information
09/11/2015
the responsibilities related to the storage, access, and use of university administrative
information section was updated to include specific guidelines about internal sharing of
university administrative information.
4/2/2024 major revision. restructured document for clarity and more defined groupings of
requirements. replaced "university administrative information" with "administrative data"
and aligned that definition with the definition in the administrative data management policy.
updated the definition of data steward to reference the administrative data management
policy instead of the records retention schedule. added definition for "vendor" that aligns
with the contract management policy. updated suggestive language to be directive by
replacing "should" with "shall" throughout the policy. added explicit reference to gramm-
leach-bliley act (glba) for restricted data
