. generally, one semester hour of credit represents
a total of three hours per week of in-class and out-of-class work. in this context, an hour is defined as
50 minutes. a typical course worth three semester hours would meet for a minimum of 2100 minutes,
excluding the final examination period, for a standard semester containing 15 weeks of instruction,
including final examinations. emerging delivery methodologies may necessitate determining a
semester hour of undergraduate credit with non-time based methods. these courses use
demonstration of competency, demonstration of proficiency, or fulfillment of learning objectives to
insure they are equivalent to traditionally delivered courses. students enrolled in courses in the
school of professional and continuing studies must attend at least 75 percent of the class meetings—
regardless of the reason for absence—to be eligible to receive credit for the course.
