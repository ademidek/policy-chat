. internet distance education projects
given the increasing presence of digital technologies, and the growing likelihood that distance
education projects via the internet may bring about significant changes in the practices and
fortunes of the faculty, the university desires to establish additional provisions particularly
applicable to such projects:
1. a faculty member who intends to enter into any non-university internet distance
education project in which he or she proposes to teach a course regularly or recurrently,
shall first disclose the proposed undertaking in advance to his or her dean or department
chair (or designee), who will examine the proposed undertaking in order to insure that no
conflict of interest or commitment will arise.
2. conflicts of interest or commitment will be addressed generally in accordance with the
terms of the university policy on conflicts of interest in force from time to time
