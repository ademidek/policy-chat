. typically, such approval should be sought at the same time approval is sought
to hire the replacement staff or faculty member; in situations in which the vacancy will not be filled, the office
space reassignment must be approved by the university space manager before it is announced or the timeline
for moves established. university facilities and information services must be notified of the need for moving

office should typically be limited to one move (i.e., employees within an entire department should not all
move to different offices because of one vacancy)
