. the data owner is the data trustee (or their designee, as defined by the
administrative data steward list) who has direct authority over and full responsibility for the data—not the
internal users of that data.
1. this data must be encrypted during transfer and at rest using an encryption strength of aes128, at a
minimum. the preferred encryption strength is aes 256 bit or better. this can be achieved using
encrypted zip files. if the data is being transferred via web upload, the in-transit encryption should be
tls 1.2 (weak ciphers disabled) or tls 1.3.
2. the encryption key to the encrypted data must be transferred out of bounds. that is it cannot be
transferred using the same mechanism as the data. for instance, if the data is sent via e-mail, the key
must be exchanged via phone or letter.
3. the external party must acknowledge receipt of the data
