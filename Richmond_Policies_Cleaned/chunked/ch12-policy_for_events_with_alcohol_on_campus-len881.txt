. police: to maintain order for each event, an assessment of the security needs will be undertaken. this
process is coordinated by events, conferences and support services. the university police will decide
the number of personnel, and the sponsoring organization/department or third-party user will be
responsible for payment of services.
2. excessive attendance: public safety will take priority over all other considerations in the decision to
stop or limit admission to an event. the final responsibility for this decision rests with the university
police officer on duty at the event. if the event is determined to be out of control, the university police,
in consultation with the event manager and/or appropriate university personnel, will take direct action
concerning the termination of further consumption of alcoholic beverages, or the termination of the
event itself.
