. in addition, the dean is responsible
for collaborating with university facilities to ensure the longest possible planning horizon for the
identification and development of the necessary research space. (see policy on space allocation and
facilities resources)
promises of specific space or space rental may not be made as part of any faculty or staff appointments
without written approval from the sa vp for campus operations or the evp/chief operating officer.
staff office assignments
assignment of staff work spaces will be aligned with the nature of the work; not all staff will have individual
offices or work stations. staff whose job responsibilities include welcoming visitors or serving as a first point
of contact will typically not be assigned an individual office. space allocation will be aligned with flexible
work arrangements; office-sharing and other kinds of arrangements will be implemented to maximize the use
of space among staff who regularly work remotely
