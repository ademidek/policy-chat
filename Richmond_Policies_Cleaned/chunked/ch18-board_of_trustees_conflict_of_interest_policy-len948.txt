the university seeks to avoid both "vertical" conflicts of interest, in which the covered person or his or her
family member will benefit either directly or indirectly, and "horizontal" conflicts of interest, in which the
covered person's exercise of impartial and objective judgment is potentially compromised by his or her

members, as well as the business relationships among covered persons.
