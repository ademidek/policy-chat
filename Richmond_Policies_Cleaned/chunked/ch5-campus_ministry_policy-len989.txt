. this agreement includes a list of expectations and responsibilities for all
campus ministry leaders and sending organizations and their shared commitment to working supportively
within a diverse faith community. ongoing campus ministry leaders will be required to review and sign the
agreement (https://chaplaincy.richmond.edu/practice/ministries/covenant.html
) at the beginning of each
academic year.
in addition to campus ministries and chaplaincy led programs, students may apply to form a religious or
spiritual registered student organization (rso) through the center for student involvement (csi) if an existing
program in the office of the chaplaincy can't meet a demonstrated need. students seeking to establish a
religious or spiritual rso must follow the standard processes for establishment of an rso. the university
chaplain (or other designated chaplaincy staff member) will participate in the rso affiliation review process
for all potential religious and spiritual groups
