. the approver is responsible for
actions taken by their delegate; delegation does not shift responsibility or accountability for the task from the
approver. delegations should be infrequent and for short periods of time, generally no longer than two weeks.
delegations that are more frequent or for longer periods of time must be discussed with and approved by the
university controller for financial transactions or the relevant vice president for other types of transactions.
if an employee has plans to be away from the university for five or more days, approval responsibilities
should be delegated to ensure that university business transactions are not delayed as a result of an absence.
a delegate has the same responsibilities as the approver and is acting in the approver's name. delegation may
be made only to someone who has knowledge of the transactions and relevant university policies, regulations,
and restrictions associated with the transactions
