. to be deaccessioned, an object must be in the museums'
possession for at least two years.
the museums may, as a courtesy, notify donors, descendants, or relatives of the donors of the museums'
intent to deaccession an object, although it is not obligated to do so unless so stated as a condition of the
original gift.
the criteria applied to deaccessioning and disposal are as stringent as those applied to the museums'
acquisition process, and reflect professional standards and ethics as established by the aam and the aamd.
deaccessions from the collection should be made only after evaluation based on, but not limited to, the
following criteria:
• the object does not conform to the museums' mission statement or is outside the collection development
goals of the museums;
• the object is determined to have insufficient historical, artistic or scientific significance;
• the object is determined not to be authentic;
