. the "immediate content" of a course includes both the ideas and the expression arising
extemporaneously as the course is actually taught and delivered to students in the
classroom (or otherwise at an assigned time or place), and this is so even when a
permanent record of the delivery of the course is simultaneously made (e.g., a videotaped
recording of a lecture). to this extent "the immediate content" of the course is subject to
the license.
4. the license shall include a particular right in students duly enrolled in a course to take
class notes for their personal use; but notes in or recordings of a course shall not be taken
or disseminated for commercial purposes unless approved by the instructor.
