the mission of the university of richmond is to educate in an academically challenging, intellectually
vibrant, and collaborative community dedicated to the holistic development of students and the production of

community. the statement recognizes the freedom of members of the campus community to engage in non-
disruptive counter-speech or protest. however, the statement also recognizes the university's right to
"reasonably regulate the time, place, and manner of expression to ensure that it does not disrupt classes,
operations, or university-sponsored events." similarly, the statement provides that, when protesting,
members of the campus community may not obstruct or otherwise interfere with the ability of other members
of the community to invite speakers or engage in permitted free expression.
the purpose of this policy is to provide guidelines for members of the campus community who wish to
engage in peaceful protests and demonstrations, including but not limited to picketing, marches, rallies, and
concerted or individual action during speakers or at other indoor events, (referred to collectively as
"demonstrations") and counter-protests or counter-demonstrations (referred to collectively as "counter-
demonstrations") on the university's campus.
scope:
this policy applies to all demonstrations and counter-demonstrations (as defined herein) planned to occur or
occurring on the campus of the university of richmond (the "campus") or on property owned, leased by or
otherwise under control of the university ("other ur locations"). it applies to all university students,

1 –viewpoint-neutral application
consistent with the statement, this policy is intended to establish reasonable time, place, and manner
guidelines for any demonstration or counter-demonstration that are neutral with respect to the viewpoint or
message intended to be conveyed in a demonstration or counter-demonstration.
2 - right to protest or demonstrate limited to members of the campus community
as a private institution of higher education, the university has the right to limit the use of the campus and
other ur locations by individuals who are not members of the campus community. in order to ensure the
safety of the campus community and to avoid unnecessary disruption to classes, co-curricular activities, and
university operations, the university does not permit outside organizations or individuals who are not
members of the campus community to organize or participate in demonstrations or counter-demonstrations on
the campus or other ur locations, except for roadways that are deemed to be public right-of-ways.
for purposes of this policy, the phrase "members of the campus community" is defined as current university
students, faculty, and staff, and student organizations recognized by the university.
3 - registration
any member of the campus community who seeks to conduct a demonstration or counter-demonstration on
the campus or at any other ur location, must first register the event with the university's office of events,
conferences, and support services (the "events office"). the purpose of this registration requirement is to
promote the safety of those participating in a demonstration or counter-demonstration, as well as the safety of
the campus community, and to minimize disruptions to university operations.
the events office will review all requests to conduct a demonstration or counter-demonstration in accordance
with this policy and the university's policies and procedures on the use of campus space, to the extent
applicable.
all requests to register a demonstration or counter-demonstration must be made at least three (3) business days
prior to the date of the planned demonstration or counter-demonstration. the university may permit
registration within a shorter timeframe in its reasonable discretion. the events office will use reasonable
efforts to respond to such request as quickly as possible, commensurate with an appropriate review of the
factors set forth in this policy. in conducting such review, the event's office will consult with the university
police department and such other campus officials as necessary. the events office, university police
department and other campus officials will work collaboratively with the organizers of a planned
demonstration or counter-demonstration in an effort to have the event take place in a manner consistent with
this policy. if the requested location for a demonstration or counter-demonstration is not available or is not

the organizer(s) that the event has been approved.
4 – safety and security

or counter-demonstration on the safety and security of the campus community. the university police will

5 – location, time, and duration
the events office and the university police department will work with the organizers of a planned
demonstration or counter-demonstration to identify an appropriate location for the event and to establish
parameters for the duration and timing of the event. in assessing the location, duration, and timing of a
demonstration or counter-demonstration, the events office and university police department will be guided
by the following considerations:

curricular activities, other campus events, or university operations;
• the university may place reasonable limitations on the start time and duration of a demonstration or
counter-demonstration;
• demonstrations and counter-demonstrations may not be held during breaks in the academic calendar;

facility; and
