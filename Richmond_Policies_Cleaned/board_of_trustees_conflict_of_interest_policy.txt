vice presidents, assistant vice presidents, directors, and any other university employee who has
significant purchasing and budget responsibilities; and (f) any other employee of the university or an
affiliate who meets the internal revenue service definition of key employee, as determined by the
university.
business relationship among covered persons. as used in this policy, a "business relationship"
among covered persons occurs when:
• one covered person is employed by another in a sole proprietorship or by an organization for
which another covered person serves as trustee, director, officer, key employee or of which
another covered person owns greater than a 35% interest; or
• one covered person is transacting business with another covered person (other than in the
ordinary course of either party's business on the same terms as are generally offered to the
public), directly or indirectly where the transaction(s) has a value in excess of $10,000 in the
aggregate during the university's tax year. an indirect transaction is one in which a covered
person engages in a transaction with an organization for which another covered person serves as
trustee, director, officer, key employee or owns greater than a 35% interest; or
• two covered persons each serve as a director, trustee, officer, key employee or has a greater
than 10% ownership interest in the same business or investment entity; or
• one covered person has an investment interest in a business, company, limited partnership, or
investment vehicle for which another covered person serves as an officer, director, or trustee or
owns greater than a 35% ownership interest.
except as specifically noted above, a business relationship does not include a transaction between
covered persons that is offered in the ordinary course of business on the same terms as are generally
offered to the public. additionally, attorney-client relationships, medical professional-patient relationships
and priest/clergy-penitent/communicant relationships are not considered business relationships for
purposes of this policy.
family member. as used in this policy and as defined by the internal revenue service, the term "family
member" includes spouses, ancestors, brothers, sisters, children, grandchildren, great grandchildren and
all of their respective spouses. the university also includes same-sex domestic partners in the definition
of family member.
key employee. as used in this policy and as defined by the internal revenue service, the term "key
employee" means a person, other than an officer, trustee or director, who meets all three of the following
tests:
• $150,000 test. the person receives reportable compensation from the organization and all
related organizations in excess of $150,000 for the calendar year ending with or within the
organization's tax year.
• responsibility test. the person:

gov-1000 – board of trustees conflict of interest policy

o has responsibilities, powers or influence over the organization as a whole that is similar to
those of officers, directors, or trustees; or
o manages a discrete segment or activity of the organization that represents 10% or more of the
activities, assets, income, or expenses of the organization, as compared to the organization as a
whole; or
o has or shares authority to control or determine 10% or more of the organization's capital
expenditures, operating budget or compensation for employees.
• top 20 test. is one of the 20 employees with the highest reportable compensation from the
organization or related organizations for the calendar year ending with or within the
organization's tax year.
related organization. as used in this policy, the term "related organization" means any corporation,
partnership, joint venture or other entity with respect to which a covered person or the family member of
a covered person: (a) holds an ownership interest (other than nominal amounts of stock in publicly traded
companies – nominal is defined as less than 5% of stock outstanding); (b) serves as an officer, director,
trustee, or member; or (c) is an employee or paid consultant.
gov-1000.2 – policy
fiduciary duty
under the law, trustees and officers have a fiduciary duty to the university that includes two broad
obligations – the duty of care and the duty of loyalty. in practice, not-for-profit entities, such as the
university, extend the duty of loyalty to employees when conducting business on behalf of the university.
this policy seeks to foster the duty of loyalty. the duty of loyalty requires a covered person, in the
exercise of his or her duties, to place the interests of the organization above the interests of himself or
herself or of any third party. the duty of loyalty prohibits a covered person from using his or her position
to secure personal advantage or from advantaging third parties, and it prohibits conflicts of interest.
conflicts of interest
it is the policy of the university that covered persons shall act in a manner consistent with their fiduciary
duty and responsibilities to the university and that covered persons and employees of the university and
its affiliates shall avoid situations in which their financial or other relationships with each other or with
outside entities could create an actual, apparent or potential conflict of interest or cause harm to the
university's reputation.
assessing a potential conflict of interest often depends on specific facts and circumstances, but, in general,
the university considers a conflict of interest to arise when:
• there are dual or multiple interests or loyalties, or the potential there for, that may inhibit the
exercise of objective or impartial judgment in furtherance of the mission and objectives of the
university or its affiliates; or
• a person in a position of authority over the university or its affiliates (e.g., covered persons)
may benefit financially from a decision he or she could make in such a capacity, including
indirect benefits such as to family members or businesses with which the person is closely
associated.

to present an exhaustive list of actions, situations or interests that could constitute a conflict of interest is
virtually impossible. however, the following situations either are, or are likely to result in, an actual,
apparent or potential conflict of interest and must always be disclosed, as required by this policy.
(1) disclosing to any person or using information that is received as a result of an individual's service to
the university or its affiliates, either for the purpose of gaining advantage for oneself or for a third
party, or permitting any other person to use that information for the benefit of himself or herself or
any third party.
(2) taking advantage of an opportunity, knowledge of which was derived during the course of service to
the university or its affiliates, and appropriating or permitting others to appropriate that
opportunity, or divert that opportunity, directly or indirectly, away from the university or its
affiliates and to others.
(3) any ownership interest (other than nominal amounts of stock in publicly traded companies –
nominal is defined as less than 5% of stock outstanding) in any organization with which the
university or its affiliate has or is considering an investment, transaction or business arrangement,
unless such interest has been disclosed to the university in accordance with this policy and approved
by appropriate board or management action.
(4) service on any board of directors or governing body of an organization with which the university or
its affiliate has or is considering a transaction or business arrangement, unless such service has been
disclosed to the university in accordance with this policy and approved by appropriate board or
management action.
(5) any consulting or employment relationship with an organization with which the university or its
affiliate has or is considering a transaction or business arrangement, unless such relationship has
been disclosed to the university in accordance with this policy and approved by appropriate board
or management action.
(6) any other business activity that is competitive with the business activities of the university or an
affiliate.
(7) receiving or being offered any significant gift, favor, benefit, service, payment or entertainment
from any organization with which the university or an affiliate has or is contemplating having
business dealings.
(8) any event or transaction between the university or an affiliate and a vendor or contractor that could
result in a covered person or any employee of the university or an affiliate receiving any direct or
indirect material benefit.
a transaction, event or situation that would create an actual, apparent or potential conflict of interest if a
covered person was involved would also create an actual, apparent or potential conflict of interest if it
involves a family member of a covered person and must, therefore, be disclosed, as required by this policy.
procedure for disclosure and management of conflicts and potential
conflicts

gov-1000 – board of trustees conflict of interest policy
university of richmond | 5
there are four components to the effective implementation of this policy. first, covered persons must fully
and completely disclose any interest or relationship that creates or might create an actual, apparent or
potential conflict of interest, as further described below. second, the university must determine, prior to
meetings of the board, board committees or other decision making bodies, whether any participant in such
meeting has an actual, apparent or potential conflict of interest. third, if a conflict of interests exists, the
covered person or employee must refrain from participating in the discussion of or vote on the matter from
which the conflict arises and from any attempt to influence the decision. finally, an independent
determination must be made that a transaction or relationship with a covered person or a related
organization is in the best interest of the university or its affiliates, in accordance with the university's
policy on transactions involving trustees and committee members.
disclosure
1. disclosure statement.
every covered person shall complete the disclosure statement, attached to this policy as appendix a, prior
to becoming a covered person and on an annual basis thereafter. as further described below, covered
persons shall also update the disclosure statement as soon as the information reported changes during the
year.
the university seeks to avoid both "vertical" conflicts of interest, in which the covered person or his or her
family member will benefit either directly or indirectly, and "horizontal" conflicts of interest, in which the
covered person's exercise of impartial and objective judgment is potentially compromised by his or her
business relationship (as defined herein) with another covered person. to that end, the disclosure
statement requires disclosure of the relationships and activities of the covered person and his or her family
members, as well as the business relationships among covered persons.
2. disclosure of new developments and potential transactions.
if, after completion of the annual disclosure statement, a covered person becomes aware of an actual,
apparent or potential conflict of interest, including, but not limited to a potential transaction with or
involving the university, such covered person shall promptly disclose such actual, apparent or potential
conflict of interest to the secretary to the board of trustees or the general counsel and shall update his or
her disclosure statement. the secretary to the board and/or the general counsel shall notify the rector and
chair of the audit and compliance committee of the disclosure.
the university recognizes that a covered person may be unware of a potential transaction or other activity
by the university that could create an actual, apparent or potential conflict of interest involving such
covered person. therefore, if any university officer, vice president, assistant or associate vice president, or
director becomes aware of an actual or pending transaction or other situation that could create an actual,
apparent or potential conflict of interest involving a covered person, such individual shall promptly notify
the secretary to the board and/or the general counsel. the secretary to the board and/or the general
counsel shall ensure that the affected covered person is aware of such actual, apparent, or potential conflict
of interest.
3. disclosure prior to meetings

gov-1000 – board of trustees conflict of interest policy
university of richmond | 6
prior to any meeting of the board, any board committee, the governing board of an affiliate or another
university decision making body (e.g., president's cabinet) every covered person attending such meeting
shall review the agenda items for such meeting to determine whether he or she may have an actual, apparent
or potential conflict of interest with respect to any agenda item. if a covered person realizes that he or she
may have an actual, apparent or potential conflict of interest during a meeting, he or she shall immediately
recuse himself or herself from such meeting. the covered person shall disclose to the secretary to the
board of trustees or the general counsel the nature and extent of his or her interest and any actual,
apparent or potential conflict.
identification of actual, apparent or potential conflicts
disclosure statements shall be maintained by the secretary to the board of trustees. the secretary to the
board of trustees and the general counsel shall review the disclosure statements and all updates thereto
upon receipt. prior to all meetings of the board of trustees, any board committee or the governing board of
a university affiliate, the secretary to the board of trustees and the general counsel shall review the
agenda items for such meeting to determine whether the participation of a covered person in any
discussion, deliberation or vote on such agenda items could create an actual, apparent or potential conflict of
interest.
process for addressing and managing actual, apparent or potential conflicts of interest
if it is determined that an actual, apparent or potential conflict exists, the secretary to the board of trustees
and/or the general counsel shall consult with the rector and the chair of the audit and compliance
committee, in the case of a member of the board of trustees (other than the rector or chair of the audit
and compliance committee) or a board committee, or with the president, in the case of other covered
persons, and, collectively, they shall take such action as may be reasonably necessary to eliminate such
conflict.
the university of richmond recognizes that a blanket prohibition against transactions with a covered
person or employee is not in the university's best interest. such a prohibition could well result in the
imposition of higher prices, additional costs or other disadvantages to the university. therefore, the
university will approach each such situation objectively, giving full recognition to the attendant
circumstances. in some instances, full disclosure of the facts may be all that is necessary to enable the
university to protect its interests and satisfy its obligations and to enable the members of the board of
trustees to satisfy their duty of loyalty. in other cases, it may be in the university's best interest to avoid a
transaction with a covered person or an organization in which a covered person has an interest.
if a conflict of interest exists, the covered person or employee must refrain from participating in the
discussion of the matter from which the conflict arises, and usually will be excluded from all discussions
involving such matter. the covered person must neither vote on the matter, nor attempt to influence the
vote of the decision-making body. finally, an independent determination must be made that a transaction or
relationship with a covered person or a related organization is in the best interest of the university. such
determination shall be made in accordance with the university's policy on transactions with trustees and
committee members.
the university's determination as to whether any transaction or potential transaction is subject to this
policy, whether any person is covered by this policy, and whether a conflict of interest exists shall be

gov-1000 – board of trustees conflict of interest policy

conclusive. the university reserves the right to take such action as, in its judgment, will end the conflict and
protect its interests.
sanctions
violation of this conflict of interest policy may result in disciplinary action, which for employees can
include oral reprimand, written reprimand, probation, suspension or immediate termination of employment,
and for others, such action as may be necessary in the opinion of the board of trustees to protect the
interests and comply with the responsibilities and obligations of the university.
